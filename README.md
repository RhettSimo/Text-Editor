# Just Another Text Editor

## Description
This is a text editor that uses webpack that allows you to write and edit text. This app satisfies several needs: the app needs to run without an internet connection, needs to use IndexedDB, needs to be bundled with webpack, and needs to have a service worker that caches static assets.

## Installation
Navigate to git. Clone the repo using`git clone` and the url/ssh. Navigate to your newly created directory and run `npm i`. Navigate to the client folder and enter `npm run build` to create a dist folder. Following that, navigate to the root directory of the repo and run `npm run dev`. After you have the app running on the local host, click the install button on the top left of the page. Now you'll be able to use it offline!

## Usage
Type something into the text editor. It should save to local storage.
